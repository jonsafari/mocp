What is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX designed to be
powerful and easy to use.

You just need to select a file from some directory using the menu similar to
Midnight Commander, and MOC will start playing all files in this directory
beginning from the chosen file. There is no need to create playlists like in
other players.

If you want to combine some files from one or few directories on one playlist,
you can do this. The playlist will be remembered between runs or you can save
it as an m3u file to load it whenever you want.

Need the console where MOC is running for more important things? Need to close
the X terminal emulator? You don't have to stop playing - just press q and the
interface will be detached leaving the server running. You can attach it later,
or you can attach one interface in the console, and another in the X terminal
emulator, no need to switch just to play another file.

MOC plays smoothly, regardless of system or I/O load because it uses the output
buffer in a separate thread. It doesn't cause gaps between files, because the
next file to be played is precached while playing the current file.

Supported file formats are: mp3, Ogg Vorbis, FLAC, Musepack (mpc), Speex, WAVE,
supported by FFmpeg (WMA, RealAudio, AAC, MP4), AIFF, AU, SVX, Sphere Nist WAV,
IRCAM SF, Creative VOC, SID, wavpack, MIDI, modplug.

Other features:
 - Simple mixer.
 - Color themes.
 - Searching the menu (the playlist or a directory) like M-s in Midnight
   Commander.
 - The way MOC creates titles from tags is configurable.
 - Optional character set conversion for file tags using iconv().
 - OSS, ALSA, and JACK output.
 - User defined keys.
 - Cache for files' tags.

Documentation, how to get help.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file is only a brief description of MOC, for more information is available
on the home page (http://moc.daper.net/documentation).
You can also find a discussion forum on the MOC home page.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What software is required to compile it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - UNIX system with POSIX threads (e.g., Linux or FreeBSD)
 - ncurses (probably already installed in your system)
 - C and C++ compilers (MOC is written in C, but libtool requires a C++
   compiler).
 - libdb version >= 3

To support audio formats you need:
 - Ogg Vorbis - libvorbis (http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/download/)
 - mp3 - libmad with libid3tag (ftp://ftp.mars.org/pub/mpeg/)
 - FLAC - (http://flac.sourceforge.net/)
 - WAVE, AU, AIFF, SVX, SPH, IRC, VOC - libsndfile
     (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
 - Speex - libspeex (http://www.speex.org/)
 - Musepack (mpc) - libmpcdec (http://www.musepack.net/) and taglib
     (http://developer.kde.org/~wheeler/taglib.html)
 - WMA, ReadAudio, (.ra), MP4 - FFmpeg
 	(http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/index.php)
 - modplug - libmodplug (http://modplug-xmms.sourceforge.net)
 - MIDI - libtimidity (http://timidity.sourceforge.net/)
 - SID - sidplay2 (sidplay2.sourceforge.net/)
 - wavpack - libwavpack (http://www.wavpack.com/)
 - AAC - libfaad2 and libid3tag

For network streams:
 - libcurl 7.12.0 or newer (http://curl.haxx.se)

For resampling (playing files with sample rate not supported by your hardware):
 - libresamplerate 0.1.2 or newer (http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/index.html)

For JACK (low-latency audio server):
 - http://jackit.sourceforge.net/

For librcc (fixes encoding in broken mp3 tags).
 - http://rusxmms.sourceforge.net/

Which systems is MOC running on?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I develop and test MOC under GNU/Linux. Sometimes I try to run it on other
operating systems, and I know it compiles and possibly works under:
- FreeBSD
- NetBSD
- OpenBSD

Not every release is extensivelly tested under other systems by me, so don't
expect it to run perfectly under your OS. If you have any problems, please
contact me, I'm interested where MOC can and cannot be used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to install it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generic installation instruction is included in the INSTALL file. In short, just
type:
	./configure
	make
And as root:
	make install

Under FreeBSD, NetBSD, and possibly other systems it is required to run the
configure script this way:
./configure LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run program with the 'mocp' command. The usage is simple, if you need help,
press 'h' and/or read man mocp. There is no complicated command line, nor
cryptic commands. Using MOC is as easy as using basic functions of Midnight
Commander.

You can use a configuration file placed in ~/.moc/config, but it's not required.
See config.example provided with MOC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Themes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, there are themes, because people wanted them. :)

Themes can change all colors and only colors. Example theme file with a
exhausting description is included (themes/example_theme), it is the
default MOC appearance.

Theme files should be placed in ~/.moc/themes/ or $(datadir)/moc/themes/
(e.g., /usr/local/share/moc/themes) directory, and can be selected
with the Theme configuration options or the -T command line option (see the man
page and the example configuration file).

Please send me themes you have created.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defining keys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can redefine standard keys. See the instructions in the keymap.example
file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hacking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Want to modify MOC? You are welcome, I'd love to see patches.

MOC is written in C, so you must at least know this language to make simple
changes. It is multi-threaded program, but there are places where you don't
need to worry about that (the interface is only a one thread process). It uses
autoconf, automake, and libtool chain to generate configuration/compilation
stuff, so you must know how to use it for example if you need to link to an
additional library.

The documentation for some parts of the internal API for creating decoder
plugins (file format support) and sound output drivers can be generated using
Dooxygen (http://www.doxygen.org). Just run the doxygen command from the MOC
source directory.

Before you change anything it is a good idea to check for the latest develoment
version (check out from the Subversion repository is the best). Your changes
might conflict with changes already made to the source or your feature might be
already implemented. See also the TODO file as it is updated regularly and
contains quite detailed information on future plans.

If you need help, just mail or contact me using Jabber.
