# This is a configuration file for the MOC player.  It should be named
# 'config' and placed in the ~/.moc directory.  As this file can specify
# commands which invoke other applications, MOC will refuse to start if it
# is not owned by either root or the current user, or if it is writable by
# anyone other than its owner.  All options are given with their default
# values, and therefore commented.

# Comments begin with '#'.
# You can use quotes and escape ('\') in parameters.
#
# You can have variable values substituted by enclosing the variable name
# as "${...}".  (This only applies to the portion of the option following
# the '='.)  Variables are substituted first from the environment then,
# if not found, from the configuration options.  (Note that the value of
# a configuration option substituted is that which it has at the time the
# substitution variable is encountered.)  If there is a naming conflict
# between an environment and configuration variable, you may be able to
# resolve it by using lowercase as the environment variable matches are
# case-sensitive whereas the configuration variables are not.
#
# You can also use the form "${...:-...}" where the value in the second
# position will be substituted if the variable name given in the first
# position is unset or null.
#
# So, for example:
#
#     MusicDir = /music/${USER:-public}
#     Fastdir1 = ${MusicDir}/mp3/rock
#     Fastdir2 = ${MusicDir}/mp3/electronic
#     Fastdir3 = ${MusicDir}/mp3/rap
#     Fastdir4 = ${MusicDir}/mp3/etc
#
# Variable names are limited to those accepted by the BASH shell; that
# is, those comprising the upper- and lowercase ASCII characters, digits
# and the underscore.
#
# If you need to use the "${" sequence for any other purpose, write "$${"
# and it will be replaced by "${" and not treated as a substitution.
#
# Some options take lists of strings as their values.  The strings are
# separated by colons.  Additional strings can be appended to the list
# using "+=" in place of a plain "=" to assign the value.  For an example,
# see the XTerms option.
#
# You can override any configuration option when you run MOC using the
# '-O' command line option:
#
#     mocp -O AutoNext=no -O messagelingertime=1 -O XTerms+=xxt:xwt
#
# This command line option can be repeated as many times as needed and
# the configuration option name is not case sensitive.  (Note that MOC
# does not perform variable substitution on the value of such overridden
# configuration options.)  Most option values are set before the
# configuration file is processed (which allows the new values to be
# picked up by substitutions), however list-valued options are overridden
# afterwards (which gives the choice of whether the configured values are
# replaced or added to).

# Remember that the client and server are separate processes and the
# server will retain the configuration values formed from the environment
# within which it was originally started.

# PreferredDecoders allows you to specify which decoder should be used
# for any given audio format.  It is a colon-separated list in which
# each entry is of the general form 'code(decoders)', where 'code'
# identifies the audio format and 'decoders' is a comma-separated list
# of decoders in order of preference.
#
# The audio format identifier may be either a filename extension or a
# MIME media type.  If the latter, the format is 'type/subtype' (e.g.,
# 'audio/flac').  Because different systems may give different MIME
# media types, any 'x-' prefix of the subtype is ignored both here and
# in the actual file MIME type (so all combinations of 'audio/flac' and
# 'audio/x-flac' match each other).
#
# For Internet streams the matching is done on MIME media type and on
# actual content.  For files the matches are made on MIME media type
# (if the 'UseMimeMagic' option is set) and on filename extension.  The
# MIME media type of a file is not determined until the first entry for
# MIME is encountered in the list.
#
# The matching is done in the order of appearance in the list with any
# entries added from the command line being matched before those listed
# here.  Therefore, if you place all filename extension entries before
# all MIME entries you will speed up MOC's processing of directories
# (which could be significant for remote file systems).
#
# The decoder list may be empty, in which case no decoders will be used
# for files (and files with that audio format ignored) while Internet
# streams will be assessed on the actual content.  Any decoder position
# may contain an asterisk, in which case any decoder not otherwise listed
# which can handle the audio format will be used.  It is not an error to
# list the same decoder twice, but neither does it make sense to do so.
#
# If you have a mix of audio and non-audio files in your directories, you
# may wish to include entries at top of the list which ignore non-audio
# files by extension.
#
# In summary, the PreferredDecoders option provides fine control over the
# type of matching which is performed (filename extension, MIME media
# type and streamed media content) and which decoder(s) (if any) are used
# based on the option's list entries and their ordering.
#
# Examples:   aac(aac,ffmpeg)             first try FAAD2 for AACs then FFmpeg
#             mp3()                       ignore MP3 files
#             wav(*,sndfile)              use sndfile for WAV as a last resort
#             ogg(vorbis,*):flac(flac,*)  try Xiph decoders first
#             ogg():audio/ogg()           ignore OGG files, and
#                                         force Internet selection by content
#             gz():html()                 ignore some non-audio files
#
# Any unspecified audio formats default to trying all decoders.
# Any unknown (or misspelt) drivers are ignored.
# All names are case insensitive.
# The default setting reflects the historical situation modified by
# the experience of users.
#
#PreferredDecoders  = aac(aac,ffmpeg):m4a(ffmpeg)

# The following PreferredDecoders attempt to handle the ambiguity surrounding
# container types such as OGG for files.  The first two entries will force
# a local file to the correct decoder (assuming the .ogg file contains Vorbis
# audio), while the MIME media types will cause Internet audio streams to

# Which resampling method to use.  There are a few methods of resampling
# sound supported by libresamplerate.  The default is 'Linear') which is
# also the fastest.  A better description can be found at:
#
#    http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsamplerate/api_misc.html#Converters
#
# but briefly, the following methods are based on bandlimited interpolation
# and are higher quality, but also slower:
#
#    SincBestQuality   - really slow (I know you probably have an xx GHz
#                        processor, but it's still not enough to not see
#                        this in the top output :)  The worst case
#                        Signal-to-Noise Ratio is 97dB.
#    SincMediumQuality - much faster.
#    SincFastest       - the fastest bandlimited interpolation.
#
# And these are lower quality, but much faster methods:
#
#    ZeroOrderHold - really poor quality, but it's really fast.
#    Linear - a bit better and a bit slower.
#
#ResampleMethod = Linear

# Always use this sample rate (in Hz) when opening the audio device (and
# resample the sound if necessary).  When set to 0 the device is opened
# with the file's rate.
#ForceSampleRate = 0

# By default, even if the sound card reports that it can output 24bit samples
# MOC converts 24bit PCM to 16bit.  Setting this option to 'yes' allows MOC
# to use 24bit output.  (The MP3 decoder, for example, uses this format.)
# This is disabled by default because there were reports that it prevents
# MP3 files from playing on some soundcards.
#Allow24bitOutput = no

# Use realtime priority for output buffer thread.  This will prevent gaps
# while playing even with heavy load.  The user who runs MOC must have
# permissions to set such a priority.  This could be dangerous, because it

#UseRealtimePriority = no

# The number of audio files for which MOC will cache tags.  When this limit

# Main window layouts can be configured.  You can change the position and
# size of the menus (directory and playlist).  You have three layouts and
# can switch between then using the 'l' key (standard mapping).  By default,
# only two layouts are configured.
#
# The format is as follows:
#
#     - Each layout is described as a list of menu entries.
#     - Each menu entry is of the form:
#
#           menu(position_x, position_y, width, height)
#
#       where 'menu' is either 'directory' or 'playlist'.
#     - The parameters define position and size of the menu.  They can
#       be absolute numbers (like 10) or a percentage of the screen size
#       (like 45%).
#     - 'width' and 'height' can have also value of 'FILL' which means
#        fill the screen from the menu's position to the border.
#     - Menus may overlap.
#
# You must describe at least one menu (default is to fill the whole window).
# There must be at least one layout (Layout1) defined; others can be empty.
#
# Example:    Layout1 = playlist(50%,50%,50%,50%)
#             Layout2 = ""
#             Layout3 = ""
#
#             Just one layout, the directory will occupy the whole
#             screen, the playlist will have 1/4 of the screen size
#             and be positioned at lower right corner.  (Note that
#             because the playlist will be hidden by the directory
#             you will have to use the TAB key to make the playlist
#             visible.)
#
# Example:    Layout1 = playlist(0,0,100%,10):directory(0,10,100%,FILL)
#
#             The screen is split into two parts: playlist at the top
#             and the directory menu at the bottom.  Playlist will
