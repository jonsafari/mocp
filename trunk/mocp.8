.SH DESRIPTION

MOC is a console audio player with simple ncurses interface. It supports OGG,
wave, and MP3 formats. Just run mocp, go to some directory using menu and
press enter to start playing file, program will be playing automaticaly rest
of the files in the directory.

With no options and no file arguments the program begins in current directory or
in MusicDir if StartInMusicDir option is set. If you give a directory on the
command line, MOC will try to go there. With files or multiple directories,
everything will be added to the playlist recursively.
