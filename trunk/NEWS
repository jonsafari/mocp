	  allows to walk through the items like in the regular menu.

	  file formats was moved to shared libraries. This should help making
	  MOC packages in future when more formats will be added.

	  matching part of ambiguous directories.
	* Volume changes made by other programs are detected.
	* Added --recursively command line option (make a playlist from the
	  content of a directory given at command line).
	* Show bitrate in the right time - the value corresponds to what you
	  can hear, not the position that the decoder is at.
	* Added description about creating a decoder plugin.
	* Added introduction pages to Doxygen documentation.
	* Documented decoder plugins API.
	* Added --playit option (play files given on the command line without
