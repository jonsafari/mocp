Items marked with $ are bigger changes requiring more time.

Known bugs:
* hight CPU usage on FreeBSD with the gui process when started to play a song.
* mp3 tags seem to be read as latin1

Before 2.4:
*$ Progrssive tags reading: read them only if the menu items requiring them
   are visible (as an option).
*$ Toggle themes at run time.
*$ a short cut to execute a command:
   http://moc.daper.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=186#186
* Call clear_area only if windows are overlaping. (if this will improve the
  performance)
* Pressing n when nothing is played should start playing from the first item
  on the playlist
* Add content of a playlist file to the playlist
* Pause Internet streams - like stop (pause) and play (unpause) the same stream
* After startup, show the playlist if we play from the playlist (as an option)

In future:

* Editing the title of an item on the playlist (for internet streams).
*$ Media library: tree-like menu for artists and albums.
* Seek by a % value (also using keys for 10%, 20% etc.)
* Ability to play from a playlist made of items found after searching.
* http://www.audioscrobbler.com/ (last.fm)
* JACK: intelligent bahaviour when we get disconnected from the server
  - detect it, try connect and exit if it fails.
* FastGo instead of FastDir: go to a directory, URL or a playlist.
* Read tags for sndfile formats.
*$ http://www.peercast.org/
* Command to see all information about a file with all tags, also all informaton
  about an internet stream (from IceCast headers like icy-url, icy-pub).
*$ Lyrics downloaded from the Internet.
* lirc
* handle SIGBUS - when mmap()ed file is truncated.
* Use pathconf() instead of PATH_MAX.
*$ libsidplay2
* Seek forward using the content of the output buffer.
*$ Locales.
* Options in a hash table.
*$ Song ratings or something like Q in XMMS.
* Configurable sorting.
* Add a key for switching sort modes.
*$ Equalizel like in Beep Media Player
*$ Make equal volume level for every song like in http://volnorm.sourceforge.net
* Seek to arbitrary position (by typing a number).
*$ VQF (like http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/linux/vqfplugin/)
*$ AAC
*$ MP4
*$ mod
*$ ESD
*$ CUE-sheet
* Command line option to delete the currently played item from the playlist.
* scripting
* APE (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac-port/)
* Some options can be changed at run-time using a menu.

Maybe never:

* posix_fadvise()
* Say about ignored options that affects server when the server is not being
  run.
* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support
