Before 2.1.0:

* General procedures for reading files instead of doing this at the decoder
  level.
* Try mmap() again if size of the file has changed.
* option to disable mmap(). (slow on NFS - use fstatfs()?) 
* Start to buffer another file when the decoder ends playing.
* Configurable sorting.
* r - also reread the playlist.
* iconv() to fix encoding.
* Use pathconf() instead of PATH_MAX.
* Showing the buffer state.
* Adding the current directory to the playlist. Helps creating sorted
  playlist.
* Update alsa mixer when changed by other application.
* Fix cursor position in the entry field.
* Fix showing time bigger than 99:59.
* Reload directory when after backing to curr_plist_menu detected that the
  directory has changed.

In future:

* fast going to a directory - when after CTRL-g user enters absolute path
  or a path that begins with ~.
* configurable saving the playlist at the end: ask, no, not if saved, always
* Cache for tags in each directory. (.cache.m3u?)
* Binary search in options code.
* True shuffle.
* 'D' command must not delete an item from the server playlist if the
  server is not playing from the playlist.
* ESD
* General error/fatal functions that recognize if they are in the interface or
  in the server and if ncurses were initialized.
* Moving items on the playlist up and down.
* Add a key for switching sort modes.
* A bar showing time for current song.
* http://www.speex.org
* Support for Audio-CD.
* Support for CDDB.
* Support for internet streams.
* flac
* libsidplay2
* Use 24-bit output if output device supports it.
* Seek forward using the content of the output buffer.
* Locales.
* special themes for xterm - after detecting xterm load XtermTheme that
  supports xterm features.
* Redefining keys.
* Do something with big interface.c - general user interface code?

Maybe never:

* When starting another client get the playlist from an already running client.
* Say about ignored options that affects server when the server is not being
  run.
* Input buffer with separate thread - like output buffer.
* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support
* Command line option to get the current state and the title of the played file.
