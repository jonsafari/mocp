Items marked with $ are bigger changes requiring more time.

Known bugs:

- Do we assume filesystem in UTF-8?  It's incorrect.
- I have a problem with MOC 2.4.0 on FreeBSD 6.1-PRERELEASE.  When I build
  MOC with musepack (libmpcdec) support MOC always core dumps on exit.
- Crash on FreeBSD 5.5 (http://moc.daper.net/node/148).
- When sorting by file name (directories), put files beginning with a
  non-alphanumeric character at the top.
- id3tags v2.3 with UTF-16 are not properly handled by libid3tag, taglib has
  no problems.  Need to use libtag here?
  NEW: recognition of ID3 tags v1 is broken (example: small.mp3).
  Thanks for the patch.  It works.  Perhaps MOC can add support for the frame
  field_type to differentiate between ID3_FIELD_TYPE_LATIN1 and
  ID3_FIELD_TYPE_STRING.
- mocp -a playlist.pls should not sort added files.
  http://moc.daper.net/node/240
- MOC needs to be restarted (when switching themes) in order to understand the
  ATTRIBUTE correctly.
- db lock timeout in tags_cache.
- Seeking in some formats does not work in the FFmpeg decoder because of
  the limitations of the FFmpeg libraries (and seeking is disabled for them).
  FLV also has seeking issues and is disabled but will be enabled if
  SEEK_IN_DECODER is set in the FFmpeg decoder plug-in.  (This may be
  parameterised in due course.)

Before 2.5:

* Move TODO to moc.daper.net/roadmap .
* A string-valued variable "TitleFormatString", similar to "FormatString".
  I'd suggest all the same %-escapes, plus:
  %F -- expands to (the expansion of) the current FormatString
  if there is a song playing or paused, and empty string if stopped.
  %S -- expands to play/stop/pause.

Transitional code removal (after 2.5):

* Remove changed option type for SidPlay2_StartAtStart.
* Remove changed option type for SidPlay2_PlaySubTunes.
* Remove changed option type for QueueNextSongReturn.
* Remove changed option type for SoundDriver.
* Remove changed option format for Layouts.
* Remove deprecated autogen.sh file.

FFmpeg/LibAV support changes (after 2.5):

* Remove deprecated ffmpeg-config support.
* Raise minimum FFmpeg/LibAV requirement to release 0.7.
* Remove supporting code for previous releases.

In future:

* Command line option to play from a specified file/first from the last
  added files.
* Multiple file selection to move many files at once up and down.
  http://moc.daper.net/node/288
* Review strcat()/strcpy()/sprintf() usage, change to
  strncat()/strncpy()/snprintf() where possible.
* More side menus: many directory/playlist views.
* LADSPA
* Editing the title of an item on the playlist (for Internet streams).
*$ Media library: tree-like menu for artists and albums.
* Seek by a % value (also using keys for 10%, 20%, etc).
* Ability to play from a playlist made of items found after searching.
* JACK: intelligent behaviour when we get disconnected from the server
  - detect it, try connect and exit if it fails.
* FastGo instead of FastDir: go to a directory, URL or a playlist.
* Read tags for sndfile formats.
*$ http://www.peercast.org/
* Crossfeed.
* Command to see all information about a file with all tags, also all
  information about an internet stream (from IceCast headers like icy-url,
  icy-pub).
*$ Lyrics downloaded from the Internet.
* lirc.
* Don't use PATH_MAX.
* Seek forward using the content of the output buffer.
*$ Locales.
*$ Song ratings or something like Q in XMMS.
* Configurable sorting.
* Add a key for switching sort modes.
*$ Equalizer like in Beep Media Player
*$ Make equal volume level for every song like in http://volnorm.sourceforge.net
*$ Replaygain.
* Seek to arbitrary position (by typing a number).
*$ VQF (like http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/linux/vqfplugin/).
*$ ESD.
*$ CUE-sheet.
* Command line option to delete the currently played item from the playlist.
* Scripting.
* APE (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac-port/).
* Some options can be changed at run-time using a menu.
* posix_fadvise() with POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED instead of the input buffer thread
  for files.
* Recording played sound to a file.
* Upgrade TiMidity decoder plug-in to TiMidity++.  This would add support
  for soundfonts (.sf2) which are now more common.

Maybe never:

* Say about ignored options that affects server when the server is not being
  run.
* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support.
