Before 2.0:

* Only trying to obtain the lock for client socket when sending an event. If
  this would block, place the event in a queue. This should prevent blocking
  the decoder when the socket is busy for a longer time period. The queue
  should be checked and purged after handling the client command.
* Don't require GCC extensions.

Before 2.1.0:

* Support for multiple clients.
* Try mmap() again if size of the file has changed.
* Prebuffering.
* iconv() to fix encoding.
* Something like M-s in mc.
* configurable colors.
* Showing the buffer state.
* General procedures for reading files instead of doing this at the decoder
  level.
* Start to buffer another file when the decoder ends playing.
* Configurable sorting.
* Playlist files (m3u?).
* Option to hide file extensions.
* Configuration options and command line parameters for selecting pid file and
  socket. A parameter for selecting different configuration file.

In future:

* Moving items on the playlist up and down.
* Add a key to switching sort modes.
* A bar showing time for current song.
* http://www.speex.org
* Support for Audio-CD.
* Support for CDDB.
* Support for internet streams.
* Alsa output and mixer.
* libsidplay2
* Use 24-bit output if output device supports it.
* Seek forward using the content of the output buffer.

Maybe never:

* Input buffer with separate thread - like output buffer.
* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support
* Daily/weekly/monthly statistics of played files (Only for fun :)
* Server which provides information about currently played music + CGI/PHP
  script to show it on the web.
