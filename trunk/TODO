Items marked with $ are bigger changes requiring more time.

Known bugs:
* on 1024x768 framebuffer the volume ar is not drawn properly
* hight CPU usage on FreeBSD with the gui process when started to play a song.

Before 2.4:
*$ Better international characters handling - tags in UTF.
* UTF-8 input.
*$ Progrssive tags reading: read them only if the menu items requiring them
   are visible (as an option).
*$ Tags cache saved to a file on exit and read at startup.
* Count speex time by reading granule position from the last page.
*$ Support for Audio-CD.
*$ Support for CDDB.
* Move the playlist to see the song that is currently played.
*$ WMA.
*$ Toggle themes at run time.
* Add a command for adding an Internet stream address to the playlist.
*$ a short cut to execute a command:
   http://moc.daper.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=186#186
* Call clear_area only if windows are overlaping. (if this will improve the
  performance)
* remove leading and trailing whitespaces from entered url's

In future:

*$ Media library: tree-like menu for artists and albums.
* Seek by a % value (also using keys for 10%, 20% etc.)
* Ability to play from a playlist made of items found after searching.
* http://www.audioscrobbler.com/ (last.fm)
* JACK: intelligent bahaviour when we get disconnected from the server
  - detect it, try connect and exit if it fails.
* FastGo instead of FastDir: go to a directory, URL or a playlist.
* Read tags for sndfile formats.
*$ http://www.peercast.org/
* Command to see all information about a file with all tags, also all informaton
  about an internet stream (from IceCast headers like icy-url, icy-pub).

*$ Locales.
* Options in a hash table.
*$ Song ratings or something like Q in XMMS.
* Configurable sorting.
* Add a key for switching sort modes.
*$ Equalizel like in Beep Media Player
*$ Make equal volume level for every song like in http://volnorm.sourceforge.net
* Seek to arbitrary position (by typing a number).
*$ VQF (like http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/linux/vqfplugin/)
*$ AAC
*$ MP4
*$ mod
*$ ESD
*$ CUE-sheet
* Command line option to delete the currently played item from the playlist.
* scripting
* APE (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac-port/)

  run.
* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support
