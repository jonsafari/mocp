Items marked with $ are bigger changes requiring more time.

Known bugs:

Before 2.4:
*$ Move interface primitives (windows, entry, etc.) to a separate file.
*$ Tags cache saved to a file on exit and read at startup.
* Better plist_count() optimizations: decrease and increase time for
  deleted/added files instead of recounting total time.
* Optimize menu: store it on a list, not in a table: this should improve
  performance when deleting items.
* Count speex time by reading granule position from the last page.
* Moving items on the playlist up and down.
* Options in a hash table.
*$ Progrssive tags reading: read them only if the menu items requiring them
  are visible (as an option).
*$ Support for Audio-CD.
*$ Support for CDDB.
* Move the playlist to see the song that is currently played.
*$ WMA.
* Full paths for items on the playlist (not only file names).
* Toggle theme at run time.

In future:

* Ability to play from a playlist made of items found after searching.
* JACK: intelligent bahaviour when we get disconnected from the server
  - detect it, try connect and exit if it fails.
* FastGo instead of FastDir: go to a directory, URL or a playlist.
* Read tags for sndfile formats.
*$ http://www.peercast.org/
* Number items on the playlist.
* Command to see all information about a file with all tags, also all informaton
  about an internet stream (from IceCast headers like icy-url, icy-pub).
*$ Lyrics downloaded from the Internet.
*$ Better international characters handling - tags in UTF.
* handle SIGBUS - when mmap()ed file is truncated.
* Use pathconf() instead of PATH_MAX.
*$ libsidplay2
* Seek forward using the content of the output buffer.
*$ Locales.
*$ Song ratings or something like Q in XMMS.
* Configurable sorting.
* Add a key for switching sort modes.
*$ Equalizel like in Beep Media Player
*$ Make equal volume level for every song like in http://volnorm.sourceforge.net
* Seek to arbitrary position (by typing a number).
*$ VQF (like http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/linux/vqfplugin/)
*$ AAC
*$ MP4
*$ mod
*$ ESD
* Command line option to delete the currently played item from the playlist.
* scripting
* APE (http://sourceforge.net/projects/mac-port/)

Maybe never:

* posix_fadvise()
* Say about ignored options that affects server when the server is not being
  run.
* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support
