Before 2.2.0:
* speed up saving the playlist when the titles are known to be made from
  tags or playlist - r rereads tags.
* Ctrl-C to exit from an entry.
* When playing file - use the time read by the server in the interface.
* configurable saving the playlist at the end: ask, no, not if saved, always.
* A bar showing time for current song.
* General error/fatal functions that recognize if they are in the interface or
  in the server and if ncurses were initialized.
* Redefining keys.
* Configurable sorting.
* Do something with big interface.c - general user interface code?
* Arrow keys working in the entry field.
* Share the playlist between interfaces - one interface is a "master"?.
* When adding files to the playlist, add them also to the server's playlist
* True shuffle.

In future:

* Do something with errors while precaching that seems to belong to the current
  file
* Better international characters handling - tags in UTF.
* handle SIGBUS - when mmap()ed file is truncated.
* Showing the buffer state.
* Use pathconf() instead of PATH_MAX.
* Cache for tags in each directory. (.cache.m3u?)
* Binary search in options code.
* 'D' command must not delete an item from the server playlist if the
  server is not playing from the playlist.
* ESD
* Moving items on the playlist up and down.
* Add a key for switching sort modes.
* http://www.speex.org
* Support for Audio-CD.
* Support for CDDB.
* Support for internet streams.
* libsidplay2
* Use 24-bit output if output device supports it.
* Seek forward using the content of the output buffer.
* Locales.
* Song ratings.

Maybe never:

* Say about ignored options that affects server when the server is not being
  run.
* Input buffer with separate thread - like output buffer.
* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support
* Command line option to get the current state and the title of the played file.
