Before 2.0:

* Don't count time at the buffer level, do it in player.c

* Try mmap() again if size of the file has changed.
* Generic ^r, r - reread directory.
* Adding files to a playlist of detached moc using command line.
* Run as server if stdin is not a terminal.
* Only trying to obtain the lock for client socket when sending an event. If
  this would block, place the event in a queue. This should prevent blocking
  the decoder when the socket is busy for a longer time period. The queue
  should be checked and purged after handling the client command.
* Option and a key to ignore hidden files.
* AUDIO_MAX_PLAY based on bps.
* config for mixer device (master, pcm etc)
* Configure the bahaviour when another client is connecting: EV_BUSY or drop
  the previous connection.
* Command for turning off message/error text immediately.
* Configurable pcm and mixer device.
* Update DOCS.

Before 2.1.0:

* Prebuffering.
* iconv() to fix encoding.
* Something like M-s in mc.
* configurable colors.
* Showing the buffer state.
* General procedures for reading files instead of doing this at the decoder
  level.
* Start to buffer another file when the decoder ends playing.

In future:

* Moving items on the playlist up and down.
* Input buffer with separate thread - like output buffer.
* Add a key to switching sort modes.
* A bar showing time for current song.
* Sort by tack number if present.
* http://www.speex.org
* Playlist files (m3u?).
* Option to hide file extensions.
* Support for Audio-CD.
* Support for CDDB.
* Support for internet streams.
* Alsa output and mixer.
* libsidplay2
* Use 24-bit output if output device supports it.

Maybe never:

* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support
* Daily/weekly/monthly statistics of played files (Only for fun :)
* Server which provides information about currently played music + CGI/PHP
  script to show it on the web.
