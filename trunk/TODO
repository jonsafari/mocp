Items marked with $ are bigger changes requiring more time.

Known bugs:
* Speex headers location is not detected properly. Speex problem?
* Freez when switching songs quickly.
* ./mocp -p FILE doesn't do what it should

Before 2.3.0:
* Separated iconv() conversion for file names and tags.
* A command to change the mixer device.
* prebuffer again if buffer fill drops to 0 - not so easy - input buffer is
  almost always 0 because we have a big output buffer.
* iconv() for internet tags.
* Complete to the matching part of a directory with the i command if a name is
  ambigous.
* History in the i command.
* Reread ALSA mixer to see changes made by other programs.
*$ Show the bitrate in the right time (the playback time, not while decoding).
*$ Support for Audio-CD.
*$ Support for CDDB.
*$ www.musepack.net - libmpcdec-1.2
*$ Seeking with speex.
* Add --recursive command line option: if a command line argument is a
  directory, add files from it to the playlist recursively.
* interface.c uses packet items when sending
* G points to the currently played file, not only the right "view"
* Add border color.
* Fix behaviour when the jack server dies.
* Optimize plist_find_fname().

In future:

* Ability to play from a playlist made of items found after searching.
* JACK: intelligent bahaviour when we get disconnected from the server
  - detect it, try connect and exit if it fails.
*$ WMA.
*$ Move interface primitives (windows, entry, etc.) to a separate file.
* FastGo instead of FastDir: go to a directory, URL or a playlist.
* Read tags for sndfile formats.
*$ Read tags in the server in a separate part, interface should not wait
  for the tags, the will be send if available (to all clients? cache for tags
  at the server part?). 
*$ Progrssive tags reading: read them only if the menu items requiring them
  are visible (as an option).
*$ Cache for tags in each directory. (.cache.m3u?)
*$ http://www.peercast.org/
* Number items on the playlist.
* Command to see all information about a file with all tags, also all informaton
  about an internet stream (from IceCast headers like icy-url, icy-pub).
* Move the playlist to see the song that is currently played.
*$ Lyrics downloaded from the Internet.
*$ Better international characters handling - tags in UTF.
* handle SIGBUS - when mmap()ed file is truncated.
* Use pathconf() instead of PATH_MAX.
* Options in a hash table.
* Moving items on the playlist up and down.
* Add a key for switching sort modes.
*$ libsidplay2
* Seek forward using the content of the output buffer.
*$ Locales.
*$ Song ratings or something like Q in XMMS.
* Configurable sorting.
*$ Equalizel like in Beep Media Player
*$ Make equal volume level for every song like in http://volnorm.sourceforge.net
* Seek to arbitrary position (by typing a number).
*$ VQF (like http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/linux/vqfplugin/)
*$ ESD
* Full paths for items on the playlist (not only file names).

Maybe never:

* posix_fadvise()
* Say about ignored options that affects server when the server is not being
  run.
* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support
