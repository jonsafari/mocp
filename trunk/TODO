This file does not list all bugs which:

- are known but rarely encountered,
- are not visible to the user,
- are programming errors detectable only with the aid of testing tools,
- are benign, or
- have been reported but not yet confirmed to be attributable to MOC.

It also does not contain many "To Do" items as these are often quite fluid
and can evolve rapidly over time.

The MOC Maintainer does hold a master list containing bugs, feature requests,
program change requests and future requirements, and once it is possible to
generate this file from that list automatically it may be updated more
frequently so it is current and comprehensive.


Known Bugs:

* Character set problems:
  - Do we assume filesystem in UTF-8?  It's incorrect.
  - id3tags v2.3 with UTF-16 are not properly handled by libid3tag, taglib
    has no problems.  Need to use libtag here?
  - Recognition of ID3 tags v1 is broken (example: small.mp3).  [node/234]
  - Perhaps MOC can add support for the frame field_type to differentiate
    between ID3_FIELD_TYPE_LATIN1 and ID3_FIELD_TYPE_STRING.  [node/234]
  - Some national characters in file and directory names don't get displayed
    correctly.
* Program crashes:
  - I have a problem with MOC 2.4.0 on FreeBSD 6.1-PRERELEASE.  When I build
    MOC with musepack (libmpcdec) support MOC always core dumps on exit.
    (This may have been fixed by other storage-related patches and will be
    removed in MOC 2.7 if no one has confirmed it still exists.)
  - Using DB_THREAD in combination with DB_CREATE and DB_PRIVATE seems to
    cause a segfault on OpenWRT.  The circumvention is to configure MOC on
    OpenWRT with '--disable-cache' or set the MOC configuration option
    'TagsCacheSize' to zero.
* Valgrind-detected memory problems:
  - libasound: memory leaks
  - libdb: uninitialised parameter storage
  - libffmpeg: uninitialised storage in conditions and reads
  - libgme: uninitialised storage in conditions and reads
  - libmagic: uninitialised storage in reads
  - librcc: uninitialised storage in conditions
  - libspeex: uninitialised storage in conditions and reads
  - The problems above occur in libraries but it needs to be determined
    whether they somehow arise from MOC's misuse of them.
  - There are many data race and mutex handling problems (particularly
    around the time of file-to-file transitions), but these are not visible
    to the users and difficult to solve without compromising gapless playback.
* Directory and playlists:
  - When sorting by file name (directories), put files beginning with a
    non-alphanumeric character at the top.
  - mocp -a playlist.pls should not sort added files.  [node/240]
  - Client does not show changes when a file's tags are updated by another
    program.
  - Client continues to show file names after ReadTags is toggled when
    MOC is started with 'ShowTime=yes' and 'ReadTags=no'.
* Decoder problems:
  - Seeking in some formats does not work in the FFmpeg decoder because of
    the limitations of the FFmpeg libraries (and seeking is disabled for
    them).  FLV also has seeking issues and is disabled but will be enabled
    if SEEK_IN_DECODER is set in the FFmpeg decoder plug-in.  (This may be
    parameterised in due course.)
  - Some decoders do not currently pass the MD5 sum or sample count checks.
  - The duration of some AAC audios is incorrectly reported.  This problem
    arises from the limitations of the format, but MOC now makes much more
    accurate guesses.
* Bugs of unknown origin:
  - After many hours of playing an Internet stream, the audio can begin
    to stutter.  [node/692]


Transitional Code Removal (after 2.5):

* Remove ISO C99 capable compiler requirement warning.
* Remove Autoconf version 2.64 requirement warning.
* Remove Berkeley DB version 4.1 requirement warning.
* Remove libcurl version 7.15.1 requirement warning.
* Remove ALSA version 1.0.11 requirement warning.
* Remove POPT requirement warning.
* Remove XZ requirement warning.


Pending 2.6 Changes:

* Require ISO C99 capable compiler.
* Require at least Autoconf version 2.64.
* Require at least Berkeley DB version 4.1.
* Require at least libcurl version 7.15.1.
* Require at least ALSA version 1.0.11.
* Require the POPT library (libpopt).
* Replace curl-config version checking with pkg-config.
* Make XZ the default compression for the 'make dist' target.


Pending 2.7 Changes:

* Remove FreeBSD program crash bug if no one has confirmed it still exists.


Future Wishlist (items marked with $ are bigger changes requiring more time):

* Move TODO to moc.daper.net/roadmap .
* A string-valued variable "TitleFormatString", similar to "FormatString".
  I'd suggest all the same %-escapes, plus:
  %F -- expands to (the expansion of) the current FormatString
  if there is a song playing or paused, and empty string if stopped.
  %S -- expands to play/stop/pause.
* Command line option to play from a specified file/first from the last
  added files.  [node/286]
* Multiple file selection to move many files at once up and down.  [node/288]
* Review strcat()/strcpy()/sprintf() usage, change to
  strncat()/strncpy()/snprintf() where possible.
* More side menus: many directory/playlist views.
* LADSPA/LV2
* Editing the title of an item on the playlist (for Internet streams).
*$ Media library: tree-like menu for artists and albums.
* Seek by a % value (also using keys for 10%, 20%, etc).
* Ability to play from a playlist made of items found after searching.
* JACK: intelligent behaviour when we get disconnected from the server
  - detect it, try connect and exit if it fails.
* FastGo instead of FastDir: go to a directory, URL or a playlist.
* Read tags for sndfile formats.
*$ http://www.peercast.org/
* Crossfade.
* Command to see all information about a file with all tags, also all
  information about an internet stream (from IceCast headers like icy-url,
  icy-pub).
*$ Lyrics downloaded from the Internet.
* lirc.
* Don't use PATH_MAX.
* Seek forward using the content of the output buffer.
*$ Locales.
*$ Song ratings or something like Q in XMMS.
* Configurable sorting.
* Add a key for switching sort modes.
*$ Equalizer like in Beep Media Player
*$ Make equal volume level for every song like in http://volnorm.sourceforge.net
*$ Replaygain.
* Seek to arbitrary position (by typing a number).
*$ VQF (like http://www.csn.ul.ie/~mel/projects/linux/vqfplugin/).
*$ ESD.
*$ CUE-sheet.
* Command line option to delete the currently played item from the playlist.
* Scripting.
* Some options can be changed at run-time using a menu.
* posix_fadvise() with POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED instead of the input buffer thread
  for files.
* Recording played sound to a file.
* Upgrade TiMidity decoder plug-in to TiMidity++.  This would add support
  for soundfonts (.sf2) which are now more common.


Maybe Never:

* Say about ignored options that affects server when the server is not being
  run.
* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support.  [node/743]
