Before 2.2.0:
* END, DEL, and HOME keys working in the entry field.
* History in the i command.
* True shuffle.
* Share the playlist between interfaces - one interface is a "master"?.
* When adding files to the playlist, add them also to the server's playlist
* Shift-left and Shift-right for faster, silent seeking (10 sec. per keystroke).
* iconv() for file names also.
* when a file is played and modified, and reload is used - the time is not
  updated
* valgrind the client and the server.

In future:

* Complete to the matching part of a directory with the i command if a name is
  ambigous.

  possible.
* Read tags for sndfile formats.
* Number items on the playlist.
* Command to chenge the mixer device.
* Command to go to the previously played file.
* Command to see all information about the file with all tags.
* Move the playlist to see the song that is currently played.
* Show the bitrate in the right time (the playback time, not while decoding).
* Lyrics downloaded from the Internet.
* Do something with errors while precaching that seems to belong to the current
  file.
* Cache for tags in each directory. (.cache.m3u?)
* Support for internet streams.
* Support for Audio-CD.
* Support for CDDB.
* Better international characters handling - tags in UTF.
* handle SIGBUS - when mmap()ed file is truncated.
* Showing the buffer state.
* Use pathconf() instead of PATH_MAX.
* Binary search in options code.
* 'D' command must not delete an item from the server playlist if the
  server is not playing from the playlist.
* ESD
* Moving items on the playlist up and down.
* Add a key for switching sort modes.

  run.
* Input buffer with separate thread - like output buffer.
* Funny ASCII equalizer.
* Mouse support
* Command line option to get the current state and the title of the played file.
