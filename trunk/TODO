Items marked with $ are bigger changes requiring more time.

Known bugs:
* on 1024x768 framebuffer the volume ar is not drawn properly
* hight CPU usage on FreeBSD with the gui process when started to play a song.
* -p description and the way it works is wrong.
* loading a playlist on startup gives an empty list.
* sometimes after Q the interface exits with a fatal error. 

Before 2.4:
* Optimize menu: use rb_tree for searching.
*$ Main window split into 2 parts, each of them can show a directory content,
   the playlist, and tree like directories (including playlists) with
   configurable depth (pressing a key increases/decreases the level).
*$ Better international characters handling - tags in UTF.
*$ Progrssive tags reading: read them only if the menu items requiring them
   are visible (as an option).
*$ Tags cache saved to a file on exit and read at startup.
* Count speex time by reading granule position from the last page.
* Moving items on the playlist up and down.
* Options in a hash table.
*$ Support for Audio-CD.
*$ Support for CDDB.
* Move the playlist to see the song that is currently played.
*$ WMA.
* Toggle theme at run time.
* Add a command for adding an Internet stream address to the playlist.

* Use pathconf() instead of PATH_MAX.
*$ libsidplay2
* Seek forward using the content of the output buffer.

* Configurable sorting.
* Add a key for switching sort modes.
*$ Equalizel like in Beep Media Player
*$ Make equal volume level for every song like in http://volnorm.sourceforge.net
* Seek to arbitrary position (by typing a number).
