	  port)

What system is MOC running on?

I've tested it on Linux and FreeBSD.

How to install it?

Generic instalation instruction is included in the INSTALL file. In short, just
type:
	./configure
	make
And as root:
	make install

You can use config file, see comments in config.example how to do it.

Run program with the 'mocp' command. If you need help, press 'h' and read
man mocp.

If you use FreeBSD, you may have to run configure in this way:
./configure LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

Who wrote that? Where can I send bug reports, questions or comments?
