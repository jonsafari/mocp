--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

MOC (music on console) is a console audio player for LINUX/UNIX designed to be
powerful and easy to use.

You just need to select a file from some directory using the menu similar to
Midnight Commander, and MOC will start playing all files in this directory
beginning from the chosen file. There is no need to create playlists like in
other players.

If you want to combine some files from one or few directories on one playlist,
you can do this. The playlist will be remembered between runs or you can save
it as an m3u file to load it whenever you want.

Need the console where MOC is running for more important things? Need to close
the X terminal emulator? You don't have to stop playing - just press q and the
interface will be detached leaving the server running. You can attach it later,
or you can attach one interface in the console, and another in the X terminal
emulator, no need to switch just to play another file.

MOC plays smoothly, regardless of system or I/O load because it uses the output
buffer in a separate thread. It doesn't cause gaps between files, because the
next file to be played is precached while playing the current file.

Supported file formats are: MP3, OGG Vorbis, FLAC, WAVE, AIFF, AU, SVX,
Sphere Nist WAV, IRCAM SF, Creative VOC.

Other features:
 - Simple mixer.
 - Color themes.
 - Searching the menu (the playlist or a directory) like M-s in Midnight
   Commander.
 - The way MOC creates titles from tags is configurable.
 - Optional character set conversion for file tags using iconv().
 - OSS or ALSA output.
 - User defined keys.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What software is required to compile it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - UNIX system with POSIX threads (eg.. Linux or FreeBSD)
 - ncurses (probably already installed in your system)

To support audio formats you need:
 - OGG - libvorbis (http://www.xiph.org/ogg/vorbis/download/)
 - MP3 - libmad with libid3tag (ftp://ftp.mars.org/pub/mpeg/)
 - FLAC - (http://flac.sourceforge.net/)
 - WAVE, AU, AIFF, SVX, SPH, IRC, VOC - libsndfile
     (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)

For network streams:
 - libcurl 7.12.0 or newer (http://curl.haxx.se)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which systems is MOC running on?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I've tested it on Linux and FreeBSD.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to install it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Generic installation instruction is included in the INSTALL file. In short, just
type:
	./configure
	make
And as root:
	make install

If you use FreeBSD, you may have to run configure in this way:
./configure LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to use it?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run program with the 'mocp' command. The usage is simple, if you need help,
press 'h' and/or read man mocp. There is no complicated command line, nor
cryptic commands. Using MOC is as easy as using basic functions of Midnight
Commander.

You can use a configuration file placed in ~/.moc/config, but it's not required.
See config.example provided with MOC.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Themes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, there are themes, because people wanted them. :)

Themes can change all colors and only colors. Example theme file with a
exhausting description is included (themes/example_theme), it is the
default MOC appearance.

Theme files should be placed in ~/.moc/themes/ or $(datadir)/moc/themes/
(eg. /usr/local/share/moc/themes) directory, and can be selected
with the Theme configuration options or the -T command line option (see the man
page and the example configuration file).

Please send me themes you have created.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defining keys
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can redefine standard keys. See the instructions in the keymap.example
file.
