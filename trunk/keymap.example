# This is the example keymap file for MOC.  You can define your own key
# bindings for MOC commands by creating your own keymap file and setting
# the 'Keymap' option in ~/.moc/config.
#
# The format of this file is:
#
#     - Lines beginning with # are comments.
#     - Blank lines are ignored.
#     - Every other line is expected to be in one of the formats:
#
#           COMMAND = [KEY ...]
#           COMMAND += KEY ...
#
# The KEY can be:
#
#     - Just a char, like i, L, ", *
#     - CTRL-KEY sequence: ^k (CTRL-k), ^4
#     - ALT-KEY (meta) sequence: M-j (ALT-j), M-/
#     - Special keys: DOWN, UP
#                     LEFT, RIGHT
#                     HOME, END
#                     BACKSPACE
#                     INS, DEL
#                     ENTER
#                     PAGE_UP, PAGE_DOWN
#                     SPACE, TAB
#                     KEYPAD_CENTER
#                     ESCAPE
#                     F1 - F12
#
# Note that the use of a digit as a KEY is deprecated.
#
# Maximum number of KEYs for one COMMAND is 5.
#
# Omitting the KEY for a COMMAND will unbind all its default keys.  They
# will also be automatically unbound when you bind new KEYs to it. Individual
# default KEYs will be automatically unbound when they are explicitly bound
# to some other COMMAND.
#
# Using the '+=' form will cause the KEYs to be appended to any existing
# (default or explicit) bindings for the COMMAND.  Appending an existing
# default binding for the same COMMAND will cause MOC to think of that KEY
# as then being explicitly bound.
#
# Only one binding for any given COMMAND can appear in the keymap file.  One
# exception to this is that if the default keys for a COMMAND are explicitly
# unbound then a subsequent binding may appear for it.  A second exception
# is that multiple appending bindings may appear.
#
# Meta-key detection is sensitive to the ESCDELAY environment variable (see
# the manpage for ncurses(3)).  In its absence, MOC resets the default
# delay to 25ms.  If you need to emulate meta-key sequences using the ESC
# key, then you may need to set the value of ESCDELAY back to its ncurses
# default of 1000ms (but doing so will make the response to the ESC key
# sluggish).
#
# If MOC's keypresses are being filtered through some other program (in a
# GUI environment, for example) which also does meta-key detection, then
# MOC is at the mercy of the timings with which that program presents them.
